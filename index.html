    <h2>What is sustainable living?</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Sustainable living is the practice of reducing your demand on natural resources by making sure that you replace what you use to the best of your ability. Sometimes that can mean not choosing to consume a product that is made using practices that don’t promote sustainability; and sometimes it means changing how you do things so that you start becoming more of an active part of the cycle of life.
    </p> </div>
<div>
    <p>We all know that climate change, global warming, depletion of ozone layer and resource depletion are real and their impact on human and animal lives can be devastating. It is an opportunity for people to adopt actions for sustainable living that can help them to reduce their <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/consider-your-impact/carbon-calculator/" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000">carbon footprint</a> or environmental impact by altering their lifestyle. Simple measures like using public transportation more often, reducing energy consumption, becoming more eco-friendly, and consuming less meat/dairy can go a long way in reducing your environmental impact and making this planet a clean and safe place. And it all starts with a change in mentality of how a person decides to live their life.

      <h2>Becoming more enviornmentally conscious</h2>
      <p> The idea of changing everyday actions to become more enviornmentlly friendly has noticeably increased within the past year. With worldwide protests and world-renowned scientists calling out to those who have yet to aknowledge the damages the earth has had to endure because of production and consumption caused by humans. More and more people are finding ways to change their lifestyle to consume less non-renewable resources and lowering their carbon footprint.
      </p>
      <p>Being environmentally friendly simply means having a lifestyle that are better for the environment. Its all about taking small steps towards mother earth so as to make this planet a better place for our communities and generations to come. A good way would be to start with conserving water, driving less and walking more, consuming less energy, buying recycled products, eating locally grown vegetables, joining environmental groups to combat air pollution, creating less waste, planting more trees and many more.
      </p>
      <h2>Why It’s Important To Become Environmentally Friendly</h2>
      <p> You can’t just point towards one business or practice and blame them for all of our environmental woes, everything fits together like a puzzle. The more that we all do our part – the faster we will create an entire ecology of living that promotes sustainability. The first step is to begin to understand the basics of what each part of life can do to become more environmentally friendly. The next step is to begin to learn to make different choices on a personal level that start to change your awareness, and consumption of resources. The changes are surprisingly easy to make, there are more ways than you can imagine to begin to practice conservation.

      <h2>Lifestyle Changes To Go Green</h2>
      <h3>Recycling Should Be Left As A Last Resort</h3>
 
      <p>The very first reaction that you should have when given a choice to use a plastic option or not, your reaction should be to automatically refuse the plastic and find another, more sustainable material to replace. Where it's in the form of using a tote bag rather than a plastic grocery bag, using a metal/glass straw, bringing a reusable coffe mug, and much more. But, if refusing plastic isn't an option and that plastic is not compostable/biodegradable or, you don't have use for an object think in terms of a circular economy. A circular economy (often referred to simply as "circularity") is an economic system aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources. In a circular system resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, closing, and narrowing energy and material loops; this can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which has a 'take, make, dispose' model of production.<br> Proponents of the circular economy suggest that a sustainable world does not mean a drop in the quality of life for consumers, and can be achieved without loss of revenue or extra costs for manufacturers. The argument is that circular business models can be as profitable as linear models, allowing us to keep enjoying similar products and services.</p>

      <h3>Becoming Zero-Waste</h3>
      <p>Zero Waste is a set of principles focused on waste prevention that encourages the redesign of resource life cycles so that all products are reused. The goal is for no trash to be sent to landfills, incinerators, or the ocean. Currently, only 9% of plastic is actually recycled. The process recommended is one similar to the way that resources are reused in nature. The definition adopted by the Zero Waste International Alliance (ZWIA) is:<br>
      	<nbsp></nbsp>Zero Waste: The conservation of all resources by means of responsible production, consumption, reuse, and recovery of all products, packaging, and materials, without burning them, and without discharges to land, water, or air that threaten the environment or human health.<br>
      	Zero Waste refers to waste prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe waste management. It is a whole systems approach that aims for a massive change in the way materials flow through society, resulting in no waste. Zero waste encompasses more than eliminating waste through recycling and reuse, it focuses on restructuring production and distribution systems to reduce waste. Zero waste is more of a goal or ideal rather than a hard target. Zero Waste provides guiding principles for continually working towards eliminating wastes.<br>

      	<h4>Coffee Vs Tea</h4>
      <p>
      	
      	A simple choice of coffee vs tea as your morning drink could help you make a "greener" option as choosing tea doesn't need as much processing as coffee and because the water footprint is around 5 times lower than coffee <br> Producing one cup of coffee requires 136 liters of water(according to a report by Friends of the Earth) whereas to produce a cup of tea you need significantly less. <br> However, if you drink milk with your tea, that right there, increases the carbon footprint as the milk element of your beverage has an even greater footprint. Also think about what packaging your tea comes in. Can you buy tea leaves in bulk rather than individually wrapped bags? Just a few things to consider... <br> Now to all the coffee lovers. I can hear you saying: "What can I do in order to drink coffee in a sustainable way?" <br> A FEW TIPS: <br> 1)skip the milk, or go for less milk (if you choose to drink milk try to drink plant-based milks such as oat or hemp).<br> 2) Buy fair trade or organic coffee. <br> 3) Make it at home with a french press or refillable filter/compostable pods. <br> 4) Take your own reusable cup to go.

      <h3>Eating green (literally)</h3>
  </div>
  <div>
  	<p>
      82% of the world's starving children live in countries where food is fed to animals that are then killed and eaten by wealthierindividuals in developed countries like the US, UK, and throughout Europe. <br> <!-- put this in bold -->
      We all seem to have difficulty understanding how our choices, particularly regarding items we consume such as food, could possibly have an impact on something or someone elsewhere in the world. It is so very difficult to see, feel, or extend beyond the microcosm or bubble each of us finds ourselves living within. <br>
      Hunger and poverty, in many cases, exist as a circling phenomenon, whereby one perpetuates the other. Addressing the hunger issue will help solve the poverty issue. It has been shown that growth in the agricultural sector of a developing nation is two times more effective than growth in any other area including economics. This is because in Africa and most other developing countries where there is poverty and hunger, over 75% of the working force is engaged in agriculture. Ethiopia has 95% of its income dependent upon agriculture. However, at the same time that agricultural growth is needed, it must be in organic plant based systems because this would be the most efficient use of their resources—many of which are already critically diminished such as water and land. We must remember that although climate change and extremes of water conditions from floods to droughts do obviously exist, much of the soil fertility issues that are faced by developing countries in Africa and elsewhere who have high rates of hunger and malnutrition are derived from how they have managed (or mismanaged) their own agricultural systems over the past 100 years. Nearly all researchers on this topic could agree that while there are many complex layers of influences related to hunger and that war and repressive government regimes as well as climate extremes all play a role, the most significant are poverty, lack of natural resources and inefficient use of the resources they do have. And although other influences certainly may also play a role in poverty, the most significant and long-term factor that can be changed is with the development of new plant based organic agricultural systems and the education to do so. <br> <!-- this is why you should eat green -->

      <h4>For The Animals</h4>
      <p>Preventing the exploitation of animals is not the only reason for becoming vegan, but for many it remains the key factor in their decision to go vegan and stay vegan. Having emotional attachments with animals may form part of that reason, while many believe that all sentient creatures have a right to life and freedom. Specifics aside, avoiding animal products is one of the most obvious ways you can take a stand against animal cruelty and animal exploitation everywhere. </p>
  </div>

      <div>
      <h4>For Your Health</h4>
      <p>Well-planned vegan diets follow healthy eating guidelines, and contain all the nutrients that our bodies need. Both the British Dietetic Association and the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recognise that they are suitable for every age and stage of life. Some research has linked vegan diets with lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and lower rates of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer. <br>Going vegan is a great opportunity to learn more about nutrition and cooking, and improve your diet. Getting your nutrients from plant foods allows more room in your diet for health-promoting options like whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetables, which are packed full of beneficial fibre, vitamins and minerals.</p></div>
      <div>
      <h4>For The Enviornment</h4>
      <p>From recycling our household rubbish to cycling to work, we're all aware of ways to live a greener life. One of the most effective things an individual can do to lower their carbon footprint is to avoid all animal products. This goes way beyond the problem of cow flatulence!</p>
  </div>

  <div>
      <h4>Why is meat and dairy so bad for the environment?</h4>
      <p>The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden on the environment - from crops and water required to feed the animals, to the transport and other processes involved from farm to fork. The vast amount of grain feed required for meat production is a significant contributor to deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction. In Brazil alone, the equivalent of 5.6 million acres of land is used to grow soya beans for animals in Europe. This land contributes to developing world malnutrition by driving impoverished populations to grow cash crops for animal feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand, considerably lower quantities of crops and water are required to sustain a vegan diet, making the switch to veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our impact on the environment.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
      <h4>For People</h4>
      <p>Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affects the poorest people all over the world.</p>
  </div>
      
      <div>
      <h4>Why Vegetarian Isn't Enough</h4>
      <p>The suffering caused by the dairy and egg industry is possibly less well publicised than the plight of factory farmed animals. The production of dairy products necessitates the death of countless male calves that are of no use to the dairy farmer, as well as the premature death of cows slaughtered when their milk production decreases. Similarly, in the egg industry, even 'ethical' or 'free range' eggs involve the killing of the 'unnecessary' male chicks when just a day old.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
      <h4>Ethical Meat?</h4>
      <p>It's tempting to want to believe that the meat we eat is ethical, that our 'food animals' have lived full, happy lives and that they have experienced no pain or fear at the slaughterhouse. Yet the sad truth is that all living creatures (even those labelled 'free range' or 'organic') fear death, just as we do. No matter how they are treated when alive, they all experience the same fear when it comes to slaughter</p> <!-- insert video of how that one guy debates with college students about if it was actually ethical to eat meat -->
