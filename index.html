    <h2>What is sustainable living?</h2>
    <p>Sustainable living is the practice of reducing your demand on natural resources by making sure that you replace what you use to the best of your ability. Sometimes that can mean not choosing to consume a product that is made using practices that donâ€™t promote sustainability; and sometimes it means changing how you do things so that you start becoming more of an active part of the cycle of life.
    </p> 

    <p>We all know that climate change, global warming, depletion of ozone layer and resource depletion are real and their impact on human and animal lives can be devastating. It is an opportunity for people to adopt actions for sustainable living that can help them to reduce their <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/consider-your-impact/carbon-calculator/" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000">carbon footprint</a> or environmental impact by altering their lifestyle. Simple measures like using public transportation more often, reducing energy consumption, becoming more eco-friendly, and consuming less meat/dairy can go a long way in reducing your environmental impact and making this planet a clean and safe place. And it all starts with a change in mentality of how a person decides to live their life.
