    <h2>What is sustainable living?</h2>
    <p>Sustainable living is the practice of reducing your demand on natural resources by making sure that you replace what you use to the best of your ability. Sometimes that can mean not choosing to consume a product that is made using practices that donâ€™t promote sustainability; and sometimes it means changing how you do things so that you start becoming more of an active part of the cycle of life.</p>
