    <h2>What is sustainable living?</h2>
    <p>Sustainable living is the practice of reducing your demand on natural resources by making sure that you replace what you use to the best of your ability. Sometimes that can mean not choosing to consume a product that is made using practices that don’t promote sustainability; and sometimes it means changing how you do things so that you start becoming more of an active part of the cycle of life.
    </p> 

    <p>We all know that climate change, global warming, depletion of ozone layer and resource depletion are real and their impact on human and animal lives can be devastating. It is an opportunity for people to adopt actions for sustainable living that can help them to reduce their <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/consider-your-impact/carbon-calculator/" target="_blank" style="color: #cc0000">carbon footprint</a> or environmental impact by altering their lifestyle. Simple measures like using public transportation more often, reducing energy consumption, becoming more eco-friendly, and consuming less meat/dairy can go a long way in reducing your environmental impact and making this planet a clean and safe place. And it all starts with a change in mentality of how a person decides to live their life.

      <h2>Becoming more enviornmentally conscious</h2>
      <p> The idea of changing everyday actions to become more enviornmentlly friendly has noticeably increased within the past year. With worldwide protests and world-renowned scientists calling out to those who have yet to aknowledge the damages the earth has had to endure because of production and consumption caused by humans. More and more people are finding ways to change their lifestyle to consume less non-renewable resources and lowering their carbon footprint.
      </p>
      <p>Being environmentally friendly simply means having a lifestyle that are better for the environment. Its all about taking small steps towards mother earth so as to make this planet a better place for our communities and generations to come. A good way would be to start with conserving water, driving less and walking more, consuming less energy, buying recycled products, eating locally grown vegetables, joining environmental groups to combat air pollution, creating less waste, planting more trees and many more.
      </p>
      <h2>Why It’s Important To Become Environmentally Friendly</h2>
      <p> You can’t just point towards one business or practice and blame them for all of our environmental woes, everything fits together like a puzzle. The more that we all do our part – the faster we will create an entire ecology of living that promotes sustainability. The first step is to begin to understand the basics of what each part of life can do to become more environmentally friendly. The next step is to begin to learn to make different choices on a personal level that start to change your awareness, and consumption of resources. The changes are surprisingly easy to make, there are more ways than you can imagine to begin to practice conservation.

      <h2>Lifestyle Changes To Go Green</h2>
      <h3>Recycling Should Be Left As A Last Resort</h3>

      <p>The very first reaction that you should have when given a choice to use a plastic option or not, your reaction should be to automatically refuse the plastic and find another, more sustainable material to replace. Where it's in the form of using a tote bag made of 100% cotton rather than a plastic grocery bag, using a metal/glass straw, and much more. But, if refusing plastic isn't an option and that plastic is not compostable/biodegradable or, you don't have use for an object think in terms of a circular economy. A circular economy (often referred to simply as "circularity") is an economic system aimed at minimising waste and making the most of resources. In a circular system resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, closing, and narrowing energy and material loops; this can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling. This regenerative approach is in contrast to the traditional linear economy, which has a 'take, make, dispose' model of production.<br> Proponents of the circular economy suggest that a sustainable world does not mean a drop in the quality of life for consumers, and can be achieved without loss of revenue or extra costs for manufacturers. The argument is that circular business models can be as profitable as linear models, allowing us to keep enjoying similar products and services.</p>

      <h3>Becoming Zero-Waste</h3>

      	<h3>Coffee Vs Tea</h3>
      <p>
      	
      	A simple choice of coffee vs tea as your morning drink could help you make a "greener" option as choosing tea doesn't need as much processing as coffee and because the water footprint is around 5 times lower than coffee <br> Producing one cup of coffee requires 136 liters of water(according to a report by Friends of the Earth) whereas to produce a cup of tea you need significantly less. <br> However, if you drink milk with your tea, that right there, increases the carbon footprint as the milk element of your beverage has an even greater footprint. Also think about what packaging your tea comes in. Can you buy tea leaves in bulk rather than individually wrapped bags? Just a few things to consider... <br> Now to all the coffee lovers. I can hear you saying: "What can I do in order to drink coffee in a sustainable way?" <br> A FEW TIPS: <br> 1)skip the milk, or go for less milk (if you choose to drink milk try to drink plant-based milks such as oat or hemp).<br> 2) Buy fair trade or organic coffee. <br> 3) Make it at home with a french press or refillable filter/compostable pods. <br> 4) Take your own reusable cup to go.
